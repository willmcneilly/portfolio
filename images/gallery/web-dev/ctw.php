<h2>Catch the Worm - Coming Soon</h2>
<h3>The idea</h3>
<p>Catch the Worm is my major project for the final year of a degree in Interactive Multimedia Design.</p>
<p>It's a 'Gamified' Web App, which makes the whole business of waking up early easier. You play the role of a trainee 'Wormcatcher', you have seventy days to rise up through the ranks and take your position along side legendary Worm Catchers such as Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>To become a Wormcatcher means you must rise early, get up late and other Wormcatchers will have taken all the best worms. You just can't jump straight into trying to rise early everyday so a schedule is made, based on your usual rising time and the time you would like to be able to rise at. The schedule gently decreases the rising time for you over seventy days, helping to cement the habit of rising early.</p>
<p>Check in at your allotted wormcatching time, the earlier you are the more Worms you catch and the more experience you gain, with experience you rise through the ranks and will gain the capability of catching rarer worms.</p>

<h3>The Technical bit</h3>
<p>I am exploring the use of responsive design in web apps. The backend (built with Code Ignitor) will serve up the same content for all devices whether mobile or desktop. The style, functionality and User Experience will be customised to the device type.</p>
<p>At the beta stage, IOS, Android and Desktop Browsers will be tailored to.</p>
